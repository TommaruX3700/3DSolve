## Changelog 

#### 2#, 23/09/2024 - Project new development enviroment
Choose Visual Studio 2022 as development env, created 2 folders which will contains the following sub-projects:
	- Model: base project, a buildable .cmake stand-alone project;
	- View: Qt Widget based application.

Looking forward maybe to re-convert the whole Model project to a .dll library if stuck, but for now I want to keep up
with general CMake compatibility.

Added "./common" for common files used all around the project.

Uploaded new .gitignore policies to avoid useless files.
